Ai is to mimic a human behavior.. how we talk,how we walk..etc
Ml => 1959 => Arthur Samuel
A system is created which can learn even when no proper instructions are given.
A model here is a self evolving program..  
DL => 2000 => Igor Aizenberg
To deal with huge amount of data..


Artificial Intelligence--It is the branch of computer science,by which we can createintelligent system or machines,which can behave, think, act and
make decisions like human beings.Thus it gives Man Made thinking power
The driving factors for ai are-
1. dealing with fast Data Generation
2. dealing with data Storage
3. provides Computation power

Goalof AI is--to create an expert system that exhibits intelligent behaviour,learn and demonstratethe explanation and advice to its users. 
The various ways AI can learn this is--
1. Reasoning
=> Complex Problem solving
=> Judgements/ Analysis / Decision Making ability


2. Learning
=> try to learning new things
=> data gethering for Analysis & grasping

3. Perception
=> Interpretation

4. Problem solving

History of AI--

This actually started in 1941,at an initial level,

Year 1943: The first work which is now recognized as AI was done by Warren McCulloch and Walter pits in 1943. They proposed a model of artificial neurons.
Year 1949: Donald Hebb demonstrated an updating rule for modifying the connection strength between neurons. His rule is now called Hebbian learning.
Year 1950: The Alan Turing who was an English mathematician and pioneered Machine learning in 1950. 
Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in which he proposed a test. The test can check the machine's ability 
to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to human intelligence, called a Turing test

Year 1955: An Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the "first artificial intelligence program"Which was named as "Logic Theorist".
 This program had proved 38 of 52 Mathematics theorems, and find new and more elegant proofs for some theorems.
Year 1956: The word "Artificial Intelligence" first adopted by American Computer scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. 
For the first time, AI coined as an academic field.
At that time high-level computer languages such as FORTRAN, LISP, or COBOL were invented. And the enthusiasm for AI was very high at that time.

Year 1966: The researchers emphasized developing algorithms which can solve mathematical problems. 
Joseph Weizenbaum created the first chatbot in 1966, which was named as ELIZA.
Year 1972: The first intelligent humanoid robot was built in Japan which was named as WABOT-1.
The first AI winter (1974-1980)
The duration between years 1974 to 1980 was the first AI winter duration. AI winter refers to the time period where computer scientist dealt with a severe shortage of funding from government for AI researches.
During AI winters, an interest of publicity on artificial intelligence was decreased.
A boom of AI (1980-1987)
Year 1980: After AI winter duration, AI came back with "Expert System". Expert systems were programmed that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.
In the Year 1980, the first national conference of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence was held at Stanford University.
The second AI winter (1987-1993)
The duration between the years 1987 to 1993 was the second AI Winter duration.
Again Investors and government stopped in funding for AI research as due to high cost but not efficient result. The expert system such as XCON was very cost effective.
The emergence of intelligent agents (1993-2011)
Year 1997: In the year 1997, IBM Deep Blue beats world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, and became the first computer to beat a world chess champion.
Year 2002: for the first time, AI entered the home in the form of Roomba, a vacuum cleaner.
Year 2006: AI came in the Business world till the year 2006. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix also started using AI.
Deep learning, big data and artificial general intelligence (2011-present)
Year 2011: In the year 2011, IBM's Watson won jeopardy, a quiz show, where it had to solve the complex questions as well as riddles. Watson had proved that it could understand natural language and can solve tricky questions quickly.
Year 2012: Google has launched an Android app feature "Google now", which was able to provide information to the user as a prediction.
Year 2014: In the year 2014, Chatbot "Eugene Goostman" won a competition in the infamous "Turing test."
Year 2018: The "Project Debater" from IBM debated on complex topics with two master debaters and also performed extremely well.
Google has demonstrated an AI program "Duplex" which was a virtual assistant and which had taken hairdresser appointment on call, and lady on other side didn't notice that she was talking with the machine.
Now AI has developed to a remarkable level. The concept of Deep learning, big data, and data science are now trending like a boom. 
Nowadays companies like Google, Facebook, IBM, and Amazon are working with AI and creating amazing devices. 
The future of Artificial Intelligence is inspiring and will come with high intelligence.

Agent in AI collectsinformation and reacts based on that collected information. Its 2 works are-
1.perceiving environment trough sensors.
2.actuators- we act with the help of sensors.

PEAS- used to group simila typeof agents together.

P-performance measure--
E-environment
A-Actuators
S-Sensors

this are checked lets say in self driving cars..


rasa installation------------------------------------------------------------------------------

conda create -n myenv python=3.7.6

conda activate myenv

pip3 install tensorflow

pip3 install ujson

pip3 install rasa

Now,going inside d directory---

(myenv) C:\Users\itvedant>d:

(myenv) D:\>

(myenv) D:\>mkdir chatrasa

(myenv) D:\>cd chatrasa

(myenv) D:\chatrasa>

(myenv) D:\chatrasa>rasa init

press enter in between

press y

ignore in between warnings

epochs we have seen in deeplearning.

After this training, we can chat with our chatbot.

Do you want tospeak tothe trained assistant--- yes---

your input -> hi

Hey! How are you?

your input -> bye

bye

your input ->/stop-----------------brings out of chatbot

(myenv) D:\chatrasa>

----------------------------------------------
Now creating rasa chatbot---- 

first understsnding rasa--rasa is an open source ml framework used for creaing conversaional chatbots.

it is used to automate the chat and voicebased assitance and also provide support.

it also supprts the web application formats.

now,-----------------------------2.intent.webm-------------------

(myenv) D:\chatrasa>

now,we are going to understand relationship between inputs and outputs.. with which i/p... rasa is behaving or giving what o/p..

Now,open sublime text---- file---> open folder--->navigate to chatrasa

Now,the very first component to understand here is- NLP--natural lang understanding and second component to understand is Natural lang generation

i.e. we need toexplain to our system, what user is asking , so that it understands the context and second component is the response that is generated.

in sublime test-----------------------inside foldr data-----open nlu.yml----- just scroll and see it....

now,intent is something, which can help in understanding the intention.. and the listof  different ways of greeting someone are given.

now, if i write any stmt which falls under this category..then my system will understand that my intent is of greeting..

Now,lets say imkeeping greet,goodbye and affirm.... and rest all im deleting....

Im changing affirm tocreate my own intent...lets say.. instead of affirm ,i want introduction--

- intent: introduction
  examples: |
    - tell me something about yourself
    - who are you
    - are you a robot
    - introduce
    - introduce yourself
    - what is your name

Save nlu.yml

Now,when we are writing these intent,  we are not expecting that user will write exacly these sentences..but wht user will write will be very much closely 
related to these sentences..

3.domain-stories.webm-----------


Now, we are coming to a part, where our system is giving response---


goto domain.yml---and register our intent here first....delete the intents tht we donot have.... and finally we have--

intents:
  - greet
  - goodbye
  - introduction

keep speelings same---

Now,im changing the responses---in domain.yml  ----like---

So,in response to ypur greet... the computer will ask you..."Hey! How can I help you?"

Now, deleting other responses , since we donot have related intents..

Now,if someone says introduce yourself.... then it will wite--

 utter_iamabot:
  - text: "I am a highly intelligent bot."----- so final domain.yml file is like---

version: "3.1"

intents:
  - greet
  - goodbye
  - introduction

responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! How can I help you?"

  utter_goodbye:
  - text: "Bye"

  utter_iamabot:
  - text: "I am a highly intelligent bot."

session_config:
  session_expiration_time: 60
  carry_over_slots_to_new_session: true

Now,next thing is mapping of these intents and response-- i.e. defining relationship between introduction and utter_imabot

So, first save this file--

and open stories.yml--------------this file will helpus to establish the relationship between intent and response---

delete sad path 1 and sad path 2-- and make changes to 1st story--

stories:

- story: introduction path
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - intent: introduction
  - action: utter_iamabot
  - intent: goodbye
  - action: utter_goodbye

Later come to rules.yml

Now,we arenot at all concerned about rules... so delete the contents of rules.yml-- or you can comment even---

4.retraning.webm-----------------------------------

Now, since we have made changes, we need to retrain our model--- so----

goto command prompt----

(myenv) D:\chatrasa>rasa train

(myenv) D:\chatrasa>rasa shell

Your input ->  hi
Hey! How can I help you?
Your input ->  name please
I am a highly intelligent bot.

now, this is what we are talking--in nlu.yml we have not given name please.... but we have something like what is your name? so by this name word...

it understood.... and gave reply.

Your input ->  /stop

5.action.webm----------------------------------------------

Tillnow we haveseen how to define static content..what if i want tocreatea dynamic one...

for eg.time will change every moment...so if my user is asking for a time.. then we will have togive current time..

So now inside nlu.yml-------- im creating an intent--- 

- intent: current_time
  examples: |
    - tell me whats the current time
    - what is the current time
    - time
    - time please

now,register this intent in domain.yml file--- add current_time in intents---

intents:
  - greet
  - goodbye
  - introduction
  - current_time

now we dont want to generate an utter response ------------- goto actions.py file-----

uncomment all the stuff--- and do following---

ActioHelloWorld is a class which is to print Hello World

this is the original code and we are going to apply changes on this like--

def name(self) -> Text:
         return "action_current_time"----------------action_current_time is the name of the action

from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List

from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from datetime import datetime as dt

class ActionCurrentTime(Action):

     def name(self) -> Text:
         return "action_current_time"

     def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
             tracker: Tracker,
             domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
         time=str(dt.now().time())

         dispatcher.utter_message(text="Time : {}".format(time))

         return []



6.action server.webm


now goto domain.yml


intents:
  - greet
  - goodbye
  - introduction
  - current_time

actions:
  - action_current_time


Now, we have created actions and intents... now we need to create story---stories.yml---


Now, open endpoints.yml file---------------------------------------------------------- 

and uncomment action_endpoint

now goto cmd point and retrain----

(myenv) D:\chatrasa>rasa train

Now,in the mean time--- what we will do is-- we will open 1 more ananconda prompt---just in windows search bar.. search anaconda prompt

(base) C:\Users\itvedant>activate myenv

(myenv) C:\Users\itvedant>d:

(myenv) D:\>cd chatrasa

(myenv) D:\chatrasa>rasa run actions

Now,remember rasa run actions is opened on a different terminal... and in 1 terminal we have done training.

(myenv) D:\chatrasa>rasa shell

###----------------------make sure your action server is started.....

Your input ->  hi
Hey! How can I help you?
Your input ->  time
Time : 14:05:51.285845
Your input ->  name please
Time : 14:06:14.736847----------------------------this o/p is wrong. So whatever new instruction is addedtomy chatbot--is given to the intent to increase the quality
Your input ->  your name
I am a highly intelligent bot.
Your input ->  bye
Bye
Your input ->  /stop
